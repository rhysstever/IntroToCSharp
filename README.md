# IntroToCSharp

## Topic Sheet
This is  a list of topics I wish to cover in my C# Technical Seminar. I plan to base it mostly on C#'s differences to Java

## Code File
I will essentially retype all of this code during the actual seminar. The reason why I will be typing it all out real-time
so that they can understand it all better and ask questions as we go along.
