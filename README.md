# IntroToCSharp
These are the materials that I will use for my Intro To C# Technical Seminar. I will explain the C# language, 
focusing on its differences to Java. 

## Topic Sheet (Doc)
This is a list of topics I wish to cover in the seminar. It mainly includes general differences (such as using 
a List<> instead of an Arraylist) and the 3 Pillars of Object Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, Polymorphism,
and Inheritance.

## Code File
I will essentially retype all of this code during the actual seminar. I will be typing it all out real-time
so that people can understand each topic piece-by-piece and ask questions along the way.
