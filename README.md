# IntroToCSharp
The materials that I used for my Intro To C# Technical Seminar.

## Topic Sheet (Doc)
This is a list of topics I covered in the seminar. It mainly includes general differences (such as using 
a List<> instead of an Arraylist) and the 3 Pillars of Object Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, Polymorphism,
and Inheritance.

## Code File
This is the code that I typed out before giving the actual seminar. I essentially retyped all of it during the actual seminar in order for my audience to see it in real-time. Doing so helps people understand each topic piece-by-piece and ask questions along the way.
